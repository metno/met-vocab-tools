# Met Vocabulary Tools â€“ Bundled Data

## CF Standards Name Table

The file `cf-standard-name-table.xml` in the `metvocab/data` folder contains the Standard Name
Table, version 77 from 19 January 2021.

The file is added as-is, and the `CFStandard` class should be able to parse it. When the CF
Standards file is updated, the file in this folder should replaced with the latest one from:
https://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html

The file must be the XML version of the file.
